## Resources

Here are the [MATLAB main file](../assets/files/anisotropic_elasticity.txt){:target="_blank"} and two associated functions ([Double contraction](../assets/files/double_dot.txt){:target="_blank"} and [Conversion](../assets/files/stiffness_to_mat6by6.txt){:target="_blank"}) for anisotropic elasticity (fourth-order elastic moduli tensor, 9\*9 matrix form, Voigt notation 6\*6 matrix form, etc.) The theory could be found in this [[PDF]](../assets/files/Shared_1.pdf){:target="_blank"}.


Here is a [MATLAB file](../assets/files/Isotropy_function.txt){:target="_blank"} that explains the concept of **Spin of a Tensor** in isotropic functions.


## Teaching

My primary teaching objective is to equip students with a solid foundation in geomechanics, fostering their ability to think critically and innovatively. This will enable them to meet the increasing societal demands for energy and environmental sustainability. I am passionate about nurturing their capabilities and enthusiasm for advancing fundamental knowledge in geomechanics. I am keen on teaching both fundamental and applied courses in areas such as rock and soil mechanics, solid mechanics, finite element method, and elasticity and inelasticity. I also aim to offer general courses in geotechnical engineering to cultivate the upcoming generation of leaders in the field of geomechanics.
