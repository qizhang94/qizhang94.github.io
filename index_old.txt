## Short Bio

Currently, I am a research assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I work with Prof. [Zhen-Yu Yin](http://www.geoinvention.com/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to joining PolyU, I received my Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} in June 2021, advised by Prof. [Ronaldo I. Borja](https://web.stanford.edu/~borja/){:target="_blank"}. My Ph.D. thesis is **MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF UNCONVENTIONAL GEOMATERIALS**. I received my B.Eng. degree from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} in July 2016, advised by Prof. [Hehua Zhu](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/8230/index.html){:target="_blank"} for the final year project, with an undergraduate minor degree in Applied Mathematics.

## Research Interests

![What is the so-called double porosity media?](../assets/files/What_is_double_porosity.png)


![What is the typical example of transverse isotropy?](../assets/files/what_is_transverse_isotropy_in_real.jpg)

I am interested in understanding and controlling the fundamental poro-mechanical processes that determine the formation and recovery of earth resources from sedimentary rocks to achieve energy and environmental sustainability. At present, my research is focused on formulating innovative theories and developing advanced numerical methods to investigate the **multi-scale** pore structures, **multiple** fluid flow patterns, and complex **multi-physics** processes. Additionally, I am exploring the effects of bedding-induced **anisotropy**. This comprehensive investigation is aimed at facilitating a transition towards sustainable energy practices, and our results should be applicable to general porous media with slight modifications. By integrating rock experimental testing data (such as the poroelasticity constants) with poromechanics and solid mechanics theory, my team and I aim to build predictive models that can enhance our understanding of shale behavior and contribute to more efficient and sustainable energy extraction practices.

## Resources

Here are the [MATLAB main file](../assets/files/anisotropic_elasticity.txt){:target="_blank"} and two associated functions ([Double contraction](../assets/files/double_dot.txt){:target="_blank"} and [Conversion](../assets/files/stiffness_to_mat6by6.txt){:target="_blank"}) for anisotropic elasticity (fourth-order elastic moduli tensor, 9\*9 matrix form, Voigt notation 6\*6 matrix form, etc.) The theory could be found in this [[PDF]](../assets/files/Shared_1.pdf){:target="_blank"}.


Here is a [MATLAB file](../assets/files/Isotropy_function.txt){:target="_blank"} that explains the concept of **Spin of a Tensor** in isotropic functions.


## Teaching

My primary teaching objective is to equip students with a solid foundation in geomechanics, fostering their ability to think critically and innovatively. This will enable them to meet the increasing societal demands for energy and environmental sustainability. I am passionate about nurturing their capabilities and enthusiasm for advancing fundamental knowledge in geomechanics. I am keen on teaching both fundamental and applied courses in areas such as rock and soil mechanics, solid mechanics, finite element method, and elasticity and inelasticity. I also aim to offer general courses in geotechnical engineering to cultivate the upcoming generation of leaders in the field of geomechanics.


I have been teaching and giving lectures on (1) [Analytical and Numerical Methods in Geotechnical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/docdrive/CSE583_as%20of%2020230818.pdf){:target="_blank"} for Semester Two of 2022/23 and 2023/24; (2) CE620 Research Methods for Semester One of 2023/24 at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. In addition, I have been a teaching assistant for [Computational Poromechanics](https://web.stanford.edu/~borja/cour/cee294_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"} at Stanford University.
